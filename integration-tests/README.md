# integration-tests/

The test site of much of your Javascript development can happen here, in this directory.

The [`integration-tests/test-app.ts`](./test-app.ts) is an Javascript application, just like that in `src/app/`.  You can initialize it, set the [`app` singleton](../src/app/app.ts) to your test-app, and then run whatever application code you've written "against" or "using" this test-app.
